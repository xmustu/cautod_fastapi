# Third-Party Plugins

This is a curated list of CadQuery plugins that are hosted outside of this repository. The core development team of CadQuery does not control these repositories, so extra care must be taken by the user to make sure these plugins are safe to use.

## Contributing

If you are interested in having a plugin included in this list, it must meet the following criteria.

* Must have a README file with a description of the plugin (or extension), installation instructions, and an example of how to use the plugin.
* Must be able to pass a code review for safety. This is not a check to make sure the plugin is bug-free.
* If it is a plugin, just be installable via pip in the same way as the [sampleplugin](plugins/sampleplugin/README.md), unless an exception must be made due to the complexity of dependencies. Open an issue on this repository if in doubt about the installation process for your plugin.
